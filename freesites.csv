It's mostly used as an ATV area -- so it's a little thrashed and be prepared for the sound of engines at 8AM -- but otherwise camping right there on the river is very nice. Kiters and windsurfers also come here for the winds. I believe this site is designated as Oregon ""State Lands"". In June 2012, the neighbors petitioned to make this site day use only.",TRUE

-121.916245,46.999821,Carbon River,,WA,Buckley,,"Located in the Snoqualmie National Forest on a ridge over looking the Carbon River and Mount Rainier National Park.

There were many nicer, easier to access sites on the paved road in. However, they were all occupied.

The spot we were in looked as if it had been logged recently, which didn't make for great scenery. The rest of the area is beautiful though.

The road in is the northern entrace to Mount Rainier National Park. I wouldn't suggest coming down it in a big rig if the Mt. Rainier Park is closed. It was closed when we visited and turning around at the ranger station was a little tight for our 28'. Also, regardless of size, check with the NP to make sure the road in is open to at least the park entrance.

To get to the site, you need to cross a bridge over the Carbon River. We did it in our 7 ton rig. Once over, the road conditions degrade. See my pictures. In one area, the road is a river. In another, its a tight squeeze between a downed tree and rocks.

We stayed here May 3-10 2009. Absolutely no Sprint Internet or cell service.",TRUE

The biggest issue with the area was the trash. It was probably one of the most disgusting forests we\'ve seen in terms of trash.,TRUE
